Usage
-----

1. Left or right click on an orb to select its type.
2. Upload from screenshot to quickly fill out the board. 
3. Click "Solve" after completing the board.
4. Choose one solution and see how it is performed.

Requirements
------------
* ~~Screen resolution of 1280×800 or above.~~ (Now works on mobile)

It may work in other configurations but I don't guarantee it will work ☺.

TODO
----

* Introduce better solver (e.g. [this post](http://puzzleanddragonsforum.com/showthread.php?tid=1603&pid=6263#pid6263)). Currently it is just a brute-force greedy algorithm, which may not produce truly optimal result.
* Resolve overlapping lines and points.
* Simulate swapping and matching when playing the animation.
* The default weight of the profiles may need to be adjusted.
